## Burn-down Graph

*Here we need an image reflecting the advances in the Burn-down graph. Complementing the image, we need a small paragraph describing the Scrum Master opinion about the advances.*

During this sprint we've been creating the previous shown burndown graphic which is a lot better than the one we've built during sprint 1. Therefore, this one is really similar to the optimal one (grey line on the image). However, in the next sprint we should achieve a more accurate burndown especially during the initial part of the sprint.


## Burn-up (Velocity) Graph
*Here we need an image reflecting the advances in the Burn-up graph. Complementing the image, we need a small paragraph describing the Scrum Master opinion about the advances.*

As we can see in the previous image, in the second sprint we have a lot more hours but it can be justified.

On one hand, I must say that we've got a week more than in sprint 1.

On the other hand, I will explain you which issue made us do that amount of time. The main issue has been that one of our developers is still learning how to develop in android and , sincerely, we also spend our time on building and connecting the webpage. 

To conclude, also stand out that our android developers decided to create the login and to improve the comments system.

## Client Improvements 

For the conclusions we need to reflect improvement points reflected by our customer.
